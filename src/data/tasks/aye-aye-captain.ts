    briefing: "I have another resource-saving job for you. In Tiger Bay, there is a harbor that I want you to inspect. So far, we have mostly had bad luck finding anything useful on land, which is why you will now be looking for a ship at sea. The evacuation was abrupt. Therefore, it's possible that some ships were left behind in the chaos. Find a place where you can see the whole harbor. I hope you'll be successful this time. It would be useful to have our own navy. Enjoy your walk on the beach.",
    debriefing: "Nothing? So another failed attempt to get anything of value from this godforsaken island. One by one we lose the places where we can get something of any use. Shit. I hope you at least had a nice view.",
