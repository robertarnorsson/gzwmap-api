    briefing: "Friend, I've heard that you're looking for some files about the civilian evacuation around Fort Narith. I don't know who asked you to do this, but I would be tremendously grateful if you could bring the files to me instead. This kind of information would be of interest to many people, and I know how to handle such demands. I can think of one particular person who would kill for these files. I would greatly appreciate your cooperation in this matter. Knowledge is power, and that is something I would like to have for myself.",
