Maybe I'll even feel generous and share anything I can figure out with you.",

Likely just part of the same scam to scare folks away. I just can't wrap my head around why those bastards from the LAF turned a blind eye to it. They had no qualms about cracking down on everyone else on this island, so why let this slide? Keep at it, merc. Maybe you'll unearth more.",
