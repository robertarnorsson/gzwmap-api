    briefing: "Mercenary, you have to do something for me. Don't worry, I know you lot wouldn't save your own mothers from a nursing home fire if they didn't pay you upfront, so rest assured that you will be rewarded. I think even you can now agree that what the UN did here was a total sham. It wasn't an evacuation; it was expulsion, and I won't stop until I know why. I need you to head out to the UNLRA camp in Tiger Bay and find any relevant documentation. Start with a list of evacuees. I need to know who got out, at least according to them, and why some were left behind. I refuse to believe this all wasn't a part of some sick fucking plan. Well? What are you waiting for?",
    debriefing: "Look at this shit! This isn't a list of evacuess, but a list of people that were forbidden to leave the island! I knew there was something else going on here!",
