    briefing: "It has come to my attention that you have accepted an assignment to retrieve a certain folder from the Fort Narith archives. All indications are that the soldier who wants to disappear from the records is an army chief with blood on his hands. Now, I know you came here primarily to make money, but this could be a significant breakthrough in my investigation, so I would like you to think about the bigger picture and help me catch the bad guys. I probably can't give you as big a reward as you were promised, but your cooperation would greatly benefit my case. Please bring me the folder.",
    debriefing: "Well, this is something. This folder contains a lot of very interesting and useful information about a suspect I'm after. Thank you very much. Your cooperation is highly appreciated.",
