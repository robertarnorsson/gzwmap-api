    briefing: "Friend, I have the utmost respect for Mr. Handshake, and I don't want to go against him, but I am very interested in the golf club you were asked to retrieve. You see, I used to play golf in better times, and it would be encouraging to own such a beauty. I would display the golf club in a place where I could see it every day and look forward to the time when I could play this fantastic sport again. I would appreciate it very much if you could do me this little favor. I'm sure Mr. Handshake wouldn't mind not receiving this lovely golf club.",
    debriefing: "Friend, you have brightened my day. The gaiety I feel is stupendous. I will cherish this beauty like a treasure. Never shall I forget your wise choice.",
