    briefing: "Hey there, buddy. I've got a special task for you. You're gonna be a cameraman of sorts. I need you to infiltrate the military base and hack into their cameras. We need as much information on them as possible. I don't want to go a minute without being alerted when soldiers go to the HQ or leave the base. I want them on my screen 24-7. Like some Big Brother bullshit. Take these gadgets and place them in the cameras on the base. Soon, we'll know more about them than their mothers.",
    debriefing: "Wonderful! With these taped cameras, we now have the upper hand in monitoring the military base. I feel like I'm in a spy movie or something. No one will pick their nose without our knowledge. You did well, champ.",
