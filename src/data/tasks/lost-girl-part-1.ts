    briefing: "We've received a tip about a tourist who was behaving strangely and didn't evacuate with the others. This individual is described as an athletic-looking white male who vanished just before the chaos erupted. While it's possible he's just a random person acting oddly, I have my doubts. It seems unlikely that someone would vanish right before shit hit the fan. I need you to investigate this mysterious individual. Our source claims he was staying at a house somewhere west of the Tiger Bay Central shopping center, so focus your search there. I have a feeling we will find something interesting.",
    debriefing: "So, according to your findings, she went to the Blue Lagoon. I hope we can return her safely to her parents. A happy family reunion is something of a miracle in these places, but God knows I wouldn't wish for anything else.",
