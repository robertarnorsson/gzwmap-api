  briefing: "Hi, you must be new here. My name is Jie, but you can call me Lab Rat. Everybody else here already does, but I don't mind. Actually, I think it's rather cute. Makes me feel like a real soldier, having a proper callsign like that. A-ten-hut, or whatever you guys say, right? Anyway, since you're here, I have a job for you. We're facing a critical shortage of medical supplies after the recent attack. Our people are in desperate need, and it's up to us to find a solution. The UNLRA has left quite a lot of their supplies here after their hasty evacuation, and I've gotten reports of one of their trucks parkes near the town's water tower. I think they used the office building nearby as an improvised distro center, so I'd look around there if I were you. Just keep in mind that areas outside our base might be hazardous, so please be careful! There's no room for mistakes when it comes to securing the well-being of our team, and I need you on your feet, not lying on a stretcher with a bullet hole in your gut. Once you've gathered the supplies, bring them back to the base camp for immediate distribution. Good luck out there! Dismissed! Am I saying that right?",
  debriefing: "I knew I could count on you! This will be a tremendous help to everyone. Each vial, each bandage, they represent a chance for healing and recovery. It's a small victory, but one that matters so much to our people.",
  note: "You can find inside the medical tent close to the water tower.",
