    briefing: "Buddy, I need your help. Maybe you've already heard, but Huner's Paradise had some sort of VIP program for those with the deepest pockets. I don't care what sort of fucked up stuff they did, but I was contacted by the boss, and he wants to know what sort of people were in on it. There has to be a list of clients somewhere in that place, so look carefully, find it, and bring it back here. I bet some kind of administrative building should be just the spot where they'd keep something like that.",
    debriefing: "Here we go, this is some good stuff! I even recognize some of these names here. Look at that guy, he won a gold medal in Milan this year. And this chick is the CEO of a huge pharmaceutical company. Don't ask me how I know that. So many different people, but with one thing in common - they are all rich as fuck. Good job, the boss will be thrilled!",
