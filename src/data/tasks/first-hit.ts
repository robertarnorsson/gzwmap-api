    briefing: "Based on all you managed to find out during your previous work, it looks like some of the rats in the town have formed a little gang and are trying to get themselves organized. It#s also moree than probable that their leader is one who struck a deal with the LAF to undermine our operations in the area, and we can't have that, can we? Apparently, this asshole thinks he's tough shit and even wears a red beret. You'll probably find him in and around the marketplace, so gear up and shoot that stupid shit off his head!",
