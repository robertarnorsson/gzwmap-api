    briefing: "Okay, it's time to end this. The hostiles at Hunter's Paradise are still at it and keep causing us trouble. We need to eliminate the head of their little operation, and hopefully, the rest will follow soon. If I were you, I'd look for any commander-type dude, and shoot him promptly in the face. Anybody with better gear would be a hot target, so observe them carefully and take the shot. I know you got this.",
