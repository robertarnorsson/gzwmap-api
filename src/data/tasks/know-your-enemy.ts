    briefing: "Friend, how do you like Midnight Sapphire? A magnificent sight, am I right? I have fond memories of this beautiful place. In better times, you could find anything your heart desired there. I said in better times, but even today, a diligent man can find useful things. I need a favor from you. It seems that the former commander of Fort Narith, may him and his foreign parents burn in hell, was a visitor who stayed in one of the villas at the resort. Find it and bring me some documents that will tell me more about him. Go and be sure that a pleasant reward awaits you.",
    debriefing: "Ha! So, the mongrel was a double agent, feeding information to some of the other actors who have taken unwelcomed refuge in the heart of our beautiful country. Interesting, interesting. I'm not surprised he was a mole, but I suspected he was aiming a bit higher. Honestly, it's a bit of a disappointment.",
