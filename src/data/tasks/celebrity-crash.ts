    briefing: "Man, it seems Midnight Sapphire was a pervert's paradise. Remember that fucked up video we secured last time? Well, I regretfully do, but this isn't about me. No, it's about our new client. I've been contacted by a very famous celebrity who would really appreciate it if we could retrieve a VHS from his villa. He was there partying like an animal in the heat and recording some fond memories with the localsâ€”memories that could shatter his carefully crafted humanitarian image and possibly even land him in jail. Go to the resort and retrieve the tape.",
    debriefing: "Great job, buddy! Was that the only VHS tape in the villa? Good. Previous experience has taught me not to watch similar videos, so I'm glad I don't have to retraumatize myself. Here's your bonus, pal.",
