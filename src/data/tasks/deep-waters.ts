They are filth, plain and simple, who have long preyed on the weakest around here. That all ends now. I want you to pay them a little visit and introduce them to the consequences of their actions. Don't ask any questions, and just kill them, okay? Trust me, it is a blessing compared to some of the things they did to people here...",
