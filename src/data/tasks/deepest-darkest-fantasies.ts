    briefing: "I've been contacted by a wealthy individual who needs a favor. According to his information, there is supposed to be a forgotten flash drive with recordings of a politician from a neighboring state doing NSFW stuff, and he wants it. The politician has been staying at Villa Lucia. Listen, I doubt he is thirsty for it because he has some weird fucking kink for creepy politicians; it's obviously for blackmail. Nevertheless, we want to help him because we stand to gain a lot from working with this man. So search the Midnight Sapphire villas for hardcore scat porn or whatever the official was doing there, and come back soon. We need a happy ending for this task.",
    debriefing: "Shit! This is fucked up as hell! The video is weirder than I imagined, buddy, I'm not gonna lie, but the more twisted the content, the happier our client will be.",
