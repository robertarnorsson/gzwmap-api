    briefing: "Hey there, buddy. I feel like you haven't had a proper action in a while, so I came to the conclusion that the best way to hone your specific skills would be to let you go on a rampage. We need the Midnight Sapphire to be less cramped by the LAF cunts. Even though we already casued them quite a lot of trouble, the soldiers there remain strong and unyieldingâ€¦ or fucking stupid. Well, either way, that's too bad for them. Infiltrate the resort and kill as many as you can. Good hunting, champ.",
    debriefing: "Bravo! This is exactly what I wanted and what we needed. The locations protected by the LAF are falling like dominoes. A beautiful sight.",
