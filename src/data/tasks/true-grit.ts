    briefing: "Hey there, champ. Listen, I've got a little side gig going on, and I'm wondering if you'd like a piece of the action. I've got a client on the line who was here when shit hit the fan and managed to escape. However, he seems to have misplaced his prized possession - a Colt Single Action Army revolver that John Wayne himself used in True Grit. Now, I've never seen that movie; not really a Western fan, you know? But this guy is willing to pay big bucks if we get that little piece of movie memorabilia back to him. Frankly, I doubt it was even his in the first place. He's probably just using the situation to nab somebody else's property, but I really don't care about that. What matters is that if you help me with this, I might have some more work lined up your way. Off the books, of course. According to him, the revolver is in a wooden case, and it should be somewhere in the shooting range west of the resort, so you'll have your eyes peeled when you're over there, right?",
    debriefing: "Magnificent! So much money for a little shitty antique like this. Not that I'm complaining, of course. Keep silent about this, and I'll have more work coming up. You and meâ€¦ we'll be rich men before you know it, don't you worry.",
