    briefing: "Friend, it's a pleasure to see you again! May I propose a mutually advantageous arrangement? An airplane housed in one of the secured hangars at Pha Lang Airfield lacks a crucial component that would elevate its significance greatly. I currently possess this component and urge you to assume ownership of it and transfer it to the aforementioned plane. Furthermore, I kindly request you refrain from perusing the contents of the package and ensure its safekeeping. Rest assured, your compliance will be generously compensated.",
